ABOUT:

This is a DC Client, implementing most of the Direct Connect Protocol.

It maps the shares of other members of your DC network directly into your
filesystem. You can download files with common filesystem tools like cp or
stream it directly in your favorite viewer (e. g. mplayer).


REQUIREMENTS:

* ghc
* cabal-install
* fuse >2.8


HOW TO RUN:

install missing libraries with "cabal install libx"

rename and edit config file

$ cabal configure
$ cabal build
$ ./dist/build/hadcc/hadcc
browse the directory, you specified in the config
$ fusermount -u mointpoint


HOW TO INSTALL:

install missing libraries with "cabal install libx"

$ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=$HOME --user
$ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
$ runhaskell Setup.lhs install


FEATURES:
* online nicks as directory list
* view nick info 
* browse share of remote users
* download file from shares via cp & Co
  (files non seekable, but mplayer sometimes can decode direct stream)
* browse and access own share
* searches via a socket-like file (see /dosearch script)
* chat via file


TODO:
* support multiple root share directories (currently only with symlinks)
* list current transfers in some file
* run hashing in background
* option to initiate reloading of share


PROFILING:

Compiling with profile information (depending library must be installed with profiling info too)

$ cabal clean
$ cabal configure  --enable-executable-profiling --enable-library-profiling --ghc-options="-auto-all -rtsopts"
$ cabal build

Time and allocation profiling:

$ dist/build/hadcc/hadcc +RTS -p
Do stuff
$ fusermount -u mnt
$ less hadcc.prof

Heap profiling (so docs for more options)

$ dist/build/hadcc/hadcc +RTS -hd
Do stuff
$ fusermount -u mnt
$ hp2ps hadcc.hp && okular hadcc.ps
